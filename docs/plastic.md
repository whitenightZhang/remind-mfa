# Plastic MFA
## Methodology

### Stock extrapolation
For plastic stock extrapolation, the general method as described in the [Model overview](methodology.md) was slightly adjusted: Plastic stock per capita regressions over GDP per capita did not align well for different regions, as regions with lower GDP per capita currently have higher stocks per capita than more developed regions had at the same GDP per capita in the past. This was attributed to the fact that plastics is a rather novel material compared to steel and cement, and historic stocks of developed regions are therefore not representative for today's stocks in developing regions. To account for this effect, a weighted sum of logGDP per capita and time was used as a predictor in stock extrapolation according to the formula: 'log10(gdppc) * weight + time'. The weight (documented in the assumptions below) was determined from a regression of time vs. log10(gdppc) at constant stock per capita (that is not part of the repository).
Regression parameters for the stock extrapolation are derived in two steps: As a first step, in-use stocks are regressed per product category with common parameter sets for all regions. An upper bound to the saturation levels is set at the current maximum historic stock per capita for each product category over all regions. From this regression, the fitted global saturation level for each product category is used for a second regression: In-use stocks are now regressed separately per product category and region using the fitted global saturation level from the previous regression as upper bound with the exception of those regions which already exceed that stock level, where the maximum historic stock per capita in the respective region was used as upper bound.
Hence, in-use stocks are extrapolated by using separate parameter sets for each region and product category. The extrapolated in-use stocks for all product categories then add up to the total in-use stock of a region.

## Stocks
The following table presents the processes that are modelled as stocks in the plastics MFA with their respective dimensions and the lifetime model that is employed. We use an auxiliary stock for the stock extrapolation with only the dimensions that are regressed separately (r, g) to save dimensions and computation time. The auxiliary stock is computed using a dynamic stock model. The results are then transferred to the higher-dimensional in-use-stock in the MFA system by multiplying stock, inflow and outflow with the parameters "material shares in goods" and "carbon content materials". This stock is modelled as a simple flow driven stock.
